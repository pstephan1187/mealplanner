# TODO

- Group meal planning for things like holiday dinners. Allow a user to invite others (registered users or not) to add their own recipes.
- Meals: group recipes into meals.
- Recipe sharing: share your recipes with others or with the system to allow others to use them.
- Enter notes: instead of adding a recipe or meal to a meal plan, you can add a note. This could indicate a time that you will eat out, or a meal is provided, etc.
